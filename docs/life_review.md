Reviews are proceses to stop your daily life and do an introspection on how you feel, what are you heading to and how, checking what you've done and learn from your mistakes. 

Reviews can also be used as deadlines. Sometimes deadlines helps us get motivation and energy to achieve what we want if we feel low. But remember not to push yourself too hard. If deadlines do you more wrong than right, don't use them. All these tools are meant to help us, not to bring us down.

What is important is that the process is light enough so that you want to do it, and you don't take it as a burden. It's always better to do a small and quick review rather than nothing at all. At the start of the review analyze yourself to assess how much energy do you have and decide which steps of the review you want to do.

As [plannings](life_planning.md), reviews can be done at different levels of abstraction, each level gives you different benefits.

- [Weekly review](#weekly-review)
- [Month review](#month-review)
- [Trimester review](#trimester-review)
- [Year review](#year-review)

This article is the checklist I follow to do my life review, it may seem a lot
to you or may be very simple. You can take it as a base or maybe to get some
ideas and then create your own that fits your needs.

# Review tools

To do the reviews you can use the next tools:

- Review box: It's the place you leave notes for yourself when you do the review, it can be for example a physical folder or a computer text file. I use a file called `review_box.org` inside my `inbox` directory of my life manager system. It's filled after the refile of review elements captured in the rest of my inboxes.
- Month checks: It's a list of elements you want to periodically check its evolution throughout time. It's useful to analyze the validity of theories or new processes. I use the heading `Month checks` in a file called `checks.org` in the `roadmap` directory of my life manager system.
- Objective list: It's a list of elements you want to focus your energies on. It should be easy to consult. I use the heading `Month objectives` in a file called `objectives.org` in the `roadmap` directory of my life manager system.

# Weekly review

I currently don't do any review process at weekly level.

# Month review

The objectives of the month review are:

- Help you stop and analyze how you feel
- Identify what worries you.
- Assess the progress in your objectives and decisions

It's interesting to do the reviews on meaningful days such as the last one of the month. Usually we don't have enough flexibility in our life to do it exactly that day, so schedule it the closest you can to that date. It's a good idea to do both the review and the planning on the same day.

As it's a process we're going to do very often, we need it to be relatively quick and easy so as not to invest too much time or energies on it. Keep in mind that this should be an analysis at month level in terms of abstraction, here is not the place to ask yourself if you're fulfilling your life goals. As such, you don't need that much time either, just identifying the top things that pop out of your mind are more than enough.

We'll divide the review process in these phases:

- Prepare
- Discover 
- Analyze 
- Decide 

To record the results of the review create the file `references/roadmap/reviews/YYYY_MM.org`, where the month is the one that is ending with the following template:

```org
* Discover
* Analyze
* Decide
```

## Prepare

It's important that you prepare your environment for the review. You need to be present and fully focused on the process itself. To do so you can:

- Make sure you don't get interrupted: 
    - Check your task manager tools to make sure that you don't have anything urgent to address in the next hour.
    - Disable all notifications
- Set your analysis environment:
    - Put on the music that helps you get *in the zone*.
    - Get all the things you may need for the review:
        - The checklist that defines the process of your review (this document in my case).
        - Somewhere to write down the insights.
        - Your *Review box*.
        - Your *Month checks*.
        - Your *Objective list*.
    - Remove from your environment everything else that may distract you

## Discover

Try not to, but if you think of decisions you want to make that address the elements you're discovering, write them down in the `Decide` section of your review document.

There are different paths to discover actionable items:

- Analyze what is in your mind: Take 10 minutes to answer to the next questions (you don't need to answer them all):

  - What did drain your energy or brought you down emotionally this last month?
  - What worries you right now?
  - What did help you most this last month?
  - What did you enjoy most this last month?

  Notice that we do not need to review our life logging tools (diary, task manager, ...) to answer these questions. This means that we're doing an analysis of what is in our minds right now, not throughout the month. It's flawed but as we do this analysis often, it's probably fine. We add more importance to the latest events in our life anyway.

- Empty the elements you added to the `review box`.

- Process your `Month checks`. For each of them:
  - Think of whether you've met the check. 
  - If you need, add action elements in the `Discover` section of the review.
  - If you won't need the check in the next month, archive it.

- Process your `Month objectives`. For each of them:
  - Think of whether you've met the objective. 
  - If you need, add action elements in the `Discover` section of the review.
  - If you won't need the objective in the next month, archive it.

## Analyze

Of all the identified elements we need to understand them better to be able to choose the right path to address them. These elements are usually representations of a state of our lives that we want to change.

Review each of the elements you've identified, and if you can think of an immediate solution to address the element add it to the `Decide` section. From the rest, choose the two most important. Then allocate 20 minutes to think about them, address first the most important and once you feel it's analyzed enough jump to the next. You may not have time to analyze the second. That's fine. Answering the next questions may help you:

- What defines the state we want to change? 
- What are the underlying forces in your life that made you reach that state?
- To what state you want to transition to?
- What is the easiest way to reach that destination? 

For the last question you can resort to:

- Habits change
- Projects change: start or stop doing a series of tasks.
- Roadmap change

Once you have analyzed an element copy all the decisions you've made in the `Decide` section of your review document.

## Decide

Once you have a clear definition of the current state, the new and how to reach it you need to process each of the decisions you've identified through the review process so that they are represented in your task management system, otherwise you won't arrive the desired state. To do so analyze what is the best way to process each of the elements you have written in the `Decide` section. It can be one or many of the following:

- Create or tweak a habit
- Tweak your project and tasks definitions
- Create *checks* to make sure that they are not overseen. 
- Create objectives that will be checked in the next reviews (weekly and monthly).
- Create [Anki](anki.md) cards to keep the idea in your mind.

# Trimester review

The objectives of the trimester review are:

- Check how far we ended from the trimester plan
- Check if the year plan needs some adjustment
- Identify the philosophical topics of your life to address
- Identify the interesting topics to learn

# Year review

Year reviews are meant to give you an idea of:

- How much have you and your workflows evolved
- What roadmap decisions were right, which ones were wrong
- With the context you have now, you can think of how you could have avoided the
  bad decisions.

If you have the year's planning you can analyze it against your task management
tools and life logs and create a review document analyzing all.

The process then has many phases:

- [Housekeeping](#housekeeping)
- [Analysis](#analysis)
- [Planning](#planning)

## Housekeeping

As they are time expensive, probably lot of time may have passed since your last
life review, it's a good time to do some housekeeping tasks to have a tidy
environment (and data!) before you start analyzing everything.

- Extract all your media (photos, videos, text) from all your devices (mobiles,
  laptops, servers) to your central archive. For the portable devices I use
  [`syncthing`](syncthing.md) to sync all the important data to the
  [NAS](nas.md), although it's usually untidy.
- Once it's extracted tidy them all. For example you could group the pictures
  and videos in a tree of directories (`trips`, `trips/2022-06-Glasgow`,
  `trips/2022-06-Glasgow/2022-06-10-hiking-trail-lakes`, ...). As this is an
  unpleasant task I've created `claspy` a command line tool that helps you
  categorize the files into their desired paths. Do the same for the documents,
  music, binaries... everything! until you have an empty mobile and empty
  `Downloads` directory.
- Update [your ledger](beancount.md) so that it reflects the reality.
- Update [your task manager](task_management.md) systems so that it reflects the
  latest state.
- Update [your digital garden](digital_garden.md) so that you don't have any
  uncommited changes.

## Analysis

To do it I gather all the information from my
[life logging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelog) sources and start thinking
of what do I want to change. It helps me to write a markdown document with the
insights gathered in this process.

### What you have learned

It's always interesting to look back and see what you've learned throughout the
year. I have these sources of data:

- [Digital garden](#digital-garden)
- [Anki](#anki)

#### Digital garden

If you happen to have a [digital garden](digital_garden.md) you can look at your
git history to know what has changed since the last year. That's cumbersome and
ugly though, it's better to review
[your newsletters](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/newsletter/0_newsletter_index/),
although you may need to use something like
[`mkdocs-newsletter`](https://lyz-code.github.io/mkdocs-newsletter/).

While you skim through the newsletters you can add to the analysis report the
highlights of what you've learned.

You can also check
[your repository insights](git.md#get-interesting-stats-of-the-repo).

#### Anki

I use [`anki`](anki.md) to record the knowledge that I need to have in my mind.
The program has a "Stats" tab where you can see your insights of the last years
to understand how are you learning. You can also go to the "Browse" tab to sort
the cards by created and get an idea of which ones have been the most used
decks.

### What you've read

Each time I finish a book I register it in a document with a rating and
optionally a review. When doing the review I check which ones I read, which ones
I liked more, what genres have been the most popular for me, which authors. With
these data I create an analysis of what seems promising to read in the future.

I also update the section of "what you've learnt" with the insights of these
books.

### Task review

Follow the
[review process of the task management article](task_workflows#year-review).

## Planning

### What to read

With the analysis of what I've read I research for new books and create an
ordered list per genre.
