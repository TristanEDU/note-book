An identity axis is an abstract guide for action with an indefinite scope or a timeframe longer than one year. It serves as a high-level directional tool to materialise changes in your [identities](identities.md), helping to outline a general course without specifying exact destinations.

# Limitations of an axis

- It is not suitable as a final destination on a roadmap because it is too ambiguous.
- Even minor progress could be considered sufficient, leading to a lack of clear endpoints.
- One could continue indefinitely without a sense of completion, such as continuously striving for improvement.

# Axis orgmode representation

An axis is a headline or TODO headline (depending whether it's active or not) that is part of the `plan` section of an [identity](identities.md).

It can have none or many of the next sections:

## Axis analysis section

To gather the thoughts regarding the study of the axis

## Axis plan section

To gather the axis projects that will materialise the direction of the axis.

### Axis projects

To prevent endless pursuit, an axis should be broken down into projects with defined scopes that indicate when to stop advancing in that direction.

Axis projects shall:

- Have a scope shorter than 11 months so they can be managed in the life stage review.

Depending on whether the axis projects will be acted upon in the current quarter they will have two possible representations:

- If you don't plan to it will be a project section with the an√°lisis, and steps
- If you do, then it will be a link to the project section either in `projects.org` or in `backlog.org`. You can leave the analysis section below the link in `identities.org` that way it won't use precious space in your `projects.org` file.
