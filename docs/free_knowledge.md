One of the early principles of the internet has been to make knowledge free to
everyone. [Alexandra Elbakyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Elbakyan)
of [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.do/), bookwarrior of [Library
Genesis](https://libgen.fun/), [Aaron
Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz), and countless unnamed
others have fought to free science from the grips of for-profit publishers.
Today, they do it working in hiding, alone, without acknowledgment, in fear of
imprisonment, and even now wiretapped by the FBI. They sacrifice everything for
one vision: Open Science.

Some days ago, a [post appeared on
reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/nc27fv/rescue_mission_for_scihub_and_open_science_we_are/)
to rescue Sci-Hub by increasing the seeders of the [850 scihub
torrents](http://libgen.rs/scimag/repository_torrent/). The plan is to follow
the steps done last year to move [Libgen to
IPFS](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/ed9byj/library_genesis_project_update_25_million_books/)
to make it more difficult for the states to bring down this marvelous
collection.

A good way to contribute is by seeding the ill torrents. You can [generate a list of torrents that need seeding](https://annas-archive.org/torrents#generate_torrent_list) up to a limit in TB. If you follow this path, take care of IP leaking, they're
surely monitoring who's sharing.

Another way to contribute is by following the guidelines of
[freeread.org](https://freeread.org/) and contribute to the [IPFS free
library](https://freeread.org/ipfs/). Beware though, the guidelines don't
explain how to install IPFS behind a VPN or Tor. This could be contributed to
the site.
