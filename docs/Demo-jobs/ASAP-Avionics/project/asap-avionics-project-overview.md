##Configurator
###Options
1. WP Configurator
	- It is a naitive Wordpress pluging and has a lot of customisation. It costs around $80 to $120 a year depending on wether or not there is conditional logic involved...
	- [WP Configurator Demo Gallery](https://demos.wpconfigurator.com/)
	- [WP Configurator Pro Overview](https://wpconfigurator.com/pro/)
	- [WP Configurator custom logic overview](https://wpconfigurator.com/products/conditional-logic/)
2. STAGGS Pro Configurator
	- It is also a great option costing around $60 a year. The user interface is a little simpler and user friendlier in my opinion but it offer less customization.
	- [STAGGS Configurator](https://staggs.app/)

##Proposal
- highlight my avation experience
- breifly cover:
	- flyExcluxive Header Video
	- Duncan Avation interior Gallery
	- Yingling Aviation inetioriors page
	- Manns Restoration's storytelling
	- Farland Classic's project portfolio
- Then go over the config options briefly

**Recording:** [Fathom Link](https://fathom.video/share/F7jsi1tDkE2AzynsnUYtZnc_wStBkWi-)  
**Duration:** 38 minutes

## âœ… Overview
- Company: **ASAP Avionics**
- Main Contact: Mark A. Sylvester (goes by Mark; sometimes "Alex")
- Primary Goal: Rebuild outdated project website with a focus on selling G3X kits and launching full Cessna 182 rebuilds
- Desired Features:
  - Rebuild of website front-end
  - Product configurator (G3X kits, Cessna rebuild, panel builder)
  - Avionics quoting tool
  - Visual elements like video header and aircraft previews

---

## ðŸ’¬ Summary of Discussion

### Current Website
- Built in WordPress by a previous developer with little to no design experience
- Mark is open to fully rebuilding vs. salvaging the existing site
- Focus on clarity, sales, and professionalismâ€”not on legacy content

### Primary Objectives
- **Main Site Rebuild** ($1,200 quoted):
  - Full rebuild from scratch
  - 3 revisions
  - ~1 month of ongoing support post-launch
- **Product Pages/Builders:**
  - Plane builder (Cessna 182 customization: mods, paint, engine, floats)
  - Avionics panel builder or quote estimator
  - Future 3D configurator (not required for MVP)

### Budget & Expectations
- Website rebuild: $1,200
- Configurators: estimated $500â€“$700 depending on scope
- Boss prefers to see concrete proposals before releasing budget

### Project Philosophy
- MVP first, fancier interactive tools later
- Prioritize simplicity and clarity over technical complexity in V1
- Reference example: [FlyExclusive interiors page](https://example.com) for inspiration (video header + blurb + builder)

## ðŸ§° Technical Notes
- Hosting: WordPress already set up
- Will use basic best practices for SEO; no advanced SEO work
- CMS structure:
  - Long-form homepage telling the brand story
  - Calls to action and links to individual builders
  - Builders may open in new tabs

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Action Items

1. **Tristan:**
   - [ ] Draft Upwork contract for $1,200 website rebuild with 3 revisions and 1 month of support
   - [ ] Finalize quote for configurators (paint, avionics, quote tool)
   - [ ] Research/configure pre-built options for Cessna 182 mod builder, avionics panel display, and auto-quoter

2. **Mark:**
   - [ ] Discuss contract and proposal with "Bossman" (also named Mark)
   - [ ] Send list of Cessna 182 mods and rebuild features for configurator planning
   - [ ] Provide visual content or inspiration (especially panel photos and rebuild footage)

---

## ðŸ”„ Follow-Up Topics
- Optional retainer for ongoing support post-build
  - Range: $50/month (basic support) to $500/month (new pages, content updates)
- Potential second project: rebuild and revive Canadian G3X Genius website with avionics quoter

---

## ðŸ•’ Scheduling Notes
- Mark is based in Taiwan, prefers midday Taiwan time (~late night PST)
- Future meetings may need timezone coordination

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Quotes
- "We want people to be able to fully build their dream aircraft and then we build it."
- "3D doesnâ€™t matter as much for MVP. A clean builder with visuals will do."
- "We want this site to show off our capabilities, not just give info."
