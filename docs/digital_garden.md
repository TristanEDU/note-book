[Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) is a method of storing
 and maintaining knowledge in an maintainable, scalable and searchable way. They
 are also known as second brains.

Unlike in common blogging where you write an article and forget about it, posts
are treated as plants in various stages of growth and nurturing. Some might
wither and die, and others will flourish and provide a source of continued
knowledge for the gardener and folks in the community that visit.

The content is diverse, you can find ideas, articles, investigations, snippets,
resources, thoughts, collections, and other bits and pieces that I find
interesting and useful.

It's my personal [Stock](http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890), the content that’s
as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It’s what people
discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over
time.

They are a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on
the resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to
get there.

# Existing digital gardens

If you look for inspiration check my favourite digital gardens:

* [Nikita's Everything I know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz): It's awesome
    both in content quality and length, as the way he presents it.
* [Gwern's site](https://www.gwern.net/index): The way he presents content is
    unique and gorgeous. I've found myself not very hooked to the content, but
    when you find something you like it's awesome, such as the [about
    page](https://www.gwern.net/About), his article on
    [spaced repetition](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition) or the essay
    of [Death Note: L, Anonymity & Eluding
    Entropy](https://www.gwern.net/Death-Note-Anonymity).

# Link rot
Link rot occurs when hyperlinks become obsolete or broken, leading to content loss or diminished user experience. Here are some ways to mitigate link rot in digital gardens:

- Use Permalinks: Ensure that your digital garden software supports permanent URLs (permalinks) for each note or idea. Permalinks make it easier to reference and maintain links over time because they remain stable even if the underlying content changes. This is uncomfortable to do unless your editor supports it transparently.
- Regularly Update Links: You can check for broken or outdated links and replacing them with current references through by using automated link checkers.
- Implement Redirects: When restructuring your digital garden or moving content to different locations, set up redirects for old URLs to ensure that visitors are directed to the new location. This prevents link rot and maintains the continuity of your digital garden. I don't do it as I haven't found a way to automatically doing this.
- [Archive External Content](#archive-external-content): When linking to external websites or resources, consider using web archiving services to create snapshots or archives of the content. This ensures that even if the original content becomes unavailable, visitors can still access archived versions. Check [the section below](#archive-external-content) for more information
