# Software to manage the conference
There are some open source software that can make your life easier when hosting a conference:

- [Frab](https://frab.github.io/frab/)
- [Pretalx](https://pretalx.com/p/about/)
- [Wafer](https://wafer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

In addition to the management of talks from the call for papers till the event itself it can help the users visualise the talks schedule with [EventFahrplan](https://github.com/EventFahrplan/EventFahrplan?tab=readme-ov-file) which is what's used in the ChaosComputerClub congress.

If you also want to coordinate helpers and shifts take a look to [Engelsystem](https://engelsystem.de/en)
