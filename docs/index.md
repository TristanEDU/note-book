# Note Book

Welcome to my personal wiki. This site holds notes about projects, research, and day-to-day discoveries. Everything is organized with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and published online so that I can easily reference it anywhere.

## Main sections

- [Jobs](jobs/) – details and lessons from various professional engagements.
- [References](references/) – a collection of guides and external resources I frequently consult.
- [Timeline](Timeline/) – chronological entries that track progress over time.

Explore the sections above or use the navigation to browse other topics.
