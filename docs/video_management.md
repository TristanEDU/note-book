To download content from youtube there are some selfhosted services:

# [Pinchflat](https://github.com/kieraneglin/pinchflat)

It looks very good but there is no way to interact with the application [programmatically](https://github.com/kieraneglin/pinchflat/issues/435) or through [infrastructure as code](https://github.com/kieraneglin/pinchflat/issues/421)
# [tubearchivist](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist)

It seems to be meant to replace youtube with your own alternative, not to integrate it on other services such as jellyfin (although it [has a plugin for that](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist-jf-plugin))

# [ytdl-sub](https://github.com/jmbannon/ytdl-sub?tab=readme-ov-file)

You configure all in a yaml file but it looks complex to use

# [tubesync](https://github.com/meeb/tubesync)

similar to tubearchivist
