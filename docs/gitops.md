wGitOps is a popular approach for deploying applications to Kubernetes
clusters because it provides several benefits. Some of the reasons why
we might want to implement GitOps in our Kubernetes deployment process include:

1. Git is a powerful and flexible version control system that can help
  us to track and manage changes to our infrastructure and application
  configuration. This can make it easier to roll back changes or compare
  different versions of the configuration, and can help us to ensure that
  our infrastructure and applications are always in the desired state.

2. GitOps provides a declarative approach to manage the infrastructure
  and applications. This means that we specify the desired state of our
  infrastructure and applications in configuration/definition files, and
  the GitOps tool ensures that the actual state of our infrastructure
  matches the desired state. This can help to prevent configuration drift
  and ensure that our infrastructure and applications are always in the
  desired state.

3. GitOps can automate the deployment process of our applications and
  infrastructure, which can help to reduce the time and effort required to
  roll out changes. This can improve the speed and reliability of our
  deployment process, and can help us to quickly and easily deliver changes
  to our applications and infrastructure.

4. GitOps can provide a central source of truth for our infrastructure
  and application configuration. This can help to ensure that everyone on
  the team is working with the same configuration, and can prevent conflicts
  and inconsistencies that can arise when multiple people are making changes
  to the configuration or infraestructure.
