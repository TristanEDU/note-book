[Action management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_management) is the process
of managing an action through its life cycle. It involves planning, testing,
tracking, and reporting. Action management can help either individual achieve
goals, or groups of individuals collaborate and share knowledge for the
accomplishment of collective goals.

You can address action management at different levels. High level management
ensures that you choose your actions in order to accomplish a goal, low level
management helps you get things done.

When you do action management well, you benefit from:

* Reduce your mental load, so you can use those resources doing the actions you want to.
* Improve your efficiency.
* Make more realistic estimations, thus meeting the commited deadlines.
* Finish what you start.
* Know you're walking towards your ultimate goals
* Stop feeling lost or overburdened.
* Make context switches cheaper.

On the other side, action management done wrong can consume your willpower in the
exchange of lost time and a confused mind.

The tricky reality is that the factors that decide if you do it right or wrong
are different for every person, and even for a person it may change over the
time or mood states. That's why I follow the thought that action management is
a tool that is meant to help you. If it's not, you need to change your
system until it does.

A side effect is that you have to tailor your action management system yourself.
It doesn't matter how good the systems you find in the internet are, until you start getting
your hands dirty, you won't know if they work for you. So instead of trying to
discover the perfect solution, start with one that introduces the least friction
in your current processes, and evolve from that point guided by the faults you
find. Forget about instant solutions, this is a never ending marathon. Make sure
that each step is small and easy, otherwise you will get tired too soon.

# Hype flow versus a defined plan

I've found two ways to carry out my actions: following a plan and following the hype
flow.

The first one helps you finish what you started, and directs your efforts
towards big goals. The side effect is that it achieves it by setting constrains
on what to do, so you sometimes end up in the position of doing actions that you
don't want to at the moment, and suppressing yourself not to do the ones that
you want.

The second one takes advantage of letting you focus on wherever you want at the
moment, which boosts your creativity and efficiency. This way imposes less
constrains on you and is more pleasant because surfing the hype is awesome. The
side effect is that if you have many interests, you can move forward very
quickly on many directions leaving a lot of projects half done, instead of
pushing in the direction of your big goals.

The art here is to combine both at need, if you have a good plan, you may be
able to start surfing the hype, and when the time constrains start to press you,
switch to a stricter plan to be able to deliver value in time. This makes more
sense in work environments, at personal level I usually just surf the hype
unless I have a clear objective with a due date to reach.
