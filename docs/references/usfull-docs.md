#Finding the **RIGHT** set of Documentation

##Tylers suggestions on docs
- [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/) html css js (only reputable source for these)
- [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com) tells what can be used in a browser
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) good for demos and some deeper css animations and properties
- [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/) it is a great way to compile all of your docs
- **CAUTION** stack overflow. It is a challenging place with a lot of opinions and wrong answerers
