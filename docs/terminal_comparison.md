# [Alacritty](alacritty.md)

Pros:

Cons:

- The installation is difficult if you're not used to Rust.
- [Doesn't support for ligatures](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/50) so Fira Code with ligatures looks weird.
- Awful docs
- Difficult to keep updated
# [Kitty](kitty.md)
Pros:

- Built in python
- Supports ligatures
- Nice docs
- Easy installation

Cons:

- Vim bindings to move around and copy the buffer don't work well
- When you `sudo su` on a server you need to copy the `~/.terminfo` otherwise the shell is broken
- You need to replace `ssh` so that they copy that file.

# [Wezterm](wezterm.md)

Pros:

- Nice docs

Cons:

- Dev is enough narcissistic enough to not only add it in the name of the terminal but also to say his name as the main developer.
