##Notes, Reflections and Comments
###The lost Cirrius Pilot
I went into the terminal today to get keys for hanger Q and as I was leaving a Cirrius instructor who had been doing touch and goes all morning came in. He was looking very surprised and somewhat annoyed and said to me *"I am in **Idaho**! I thought that I had landed in Washinton"* I found this quite amusing. Also Hanger Q needs a new lock... it wont open!
