[Kestra](https://kestra.io/) is an [open-source orchestrator](data_orchestrators.md) designed to bring Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices to all workflows â€” from those orchestrating mission-critical operations, business processes, and data pipelines to simple Zapier-style automation. Built with an API-first philosophy, Kestra enables users to define and manage data pipelines through a simple YAML configuration file. This approach frees you from being tied to a specific client implementation, allowing for greater flexibility and easier integration with various tools and services.
