[Chaos Communication Congress](https://events.ccc.de/en/) is the best gathering of hacktivism in europe.

# Prepare yourself for the congress

You can follow [MacLemon's checklist](https://github.com/MacLemon/CongressChecklist)
## [Install the useful apps](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2024/hub/de/wiki/apps/)

### The schedule app

You can use either the Fahrplan app or giggity, I've been using the second for a while, so is the one I use

### The navigation app

`c3nav` is an application to get around the congress. The official F-droid is outdated, so add [their repository](https://f-droid.c3nav.de/fdroid/repo/?fingerprint=C1EC2D062F67A43F87CCF95B8096630285E1B2577DC803A0826539DF6FB4C95D) to get the latest version.

# [Angel's system](https://angelguide.c3heaven.de/)

Angels are participants who volunteer to make the event happen. They are neither getting paid for their work nor do they get free admission.

## [Expectation](https://angelguide.c3heaven.de/#_expectations)

Helping at our events also comes with some simple, but important expectations of you:

- Be on time for your shift or give Heaven early notice.
- Be well rested, sober and not hungry.
- Be open-minded and friendly in attitude.
- Live our moral values:
  - Be excellent to each other.
  - All creatures are welcome.

## [Quickstart](https://angelguide.c3heaven.de/#_quick_start)

- Create yourself an [Engelsystem account](https://engel.events.ccc.de/)
- Arrive at the venue
- Find [the Heaven](https://c3nav.de/) and go there.
  - Talk to a welcome angel or a shift coordinator to get your angel badge and get marked as arrived.
  - If you have any questions, you can always ask the shift coordinators behind the counter.
- Attend an angel meeting
  - Announced in the Engelsystem news
- Click yourself an interesting shift
  - Read shift descriptions first
- Participate in your shift
  - Use the navigation to find the right place.
  - Arrive a little bit early at the meeting point
- Rest for at least one hour
  - Repeat from step 5

And always, have a lot of fun.

## [The engelsystem](https://angelguide.c3heaven.de/#_the_engelsystem)
The [Engelsystem](https://engel.events.ccc.de/) is the central place to distribute the work to all the helping angels. It can be a bit overwhelming at the beginning but you will get used to it and find your way around.

As you might have seen there are many different shifts and roles for angels — some sounding more appealing than others. There are shifts where you need to have some knowledge before you can take them. This knowledge is given in introduction meetings or by taking an unrestricted shift in the team and getting trained on the job. These introduction meetings are announced in the Engelsystem under the tab "Meetings". Heaven and the teams try to make sure that there are only restrictions for shifts in place where they are absolutely needed.

Most restrictions really only need a meeting or some unrestricted shifts at the team to get lifted. Harder restrictions are in place where volunteers need to have special certification, get access to certain systems with a huge amount of data (e.g. mail-queues with emails from participants) or handling big piles of money. Usually the requirements for joining an angeltype are included in the description of the angeltype.

Especially the restricted shifts are tempting because after all we want to get the event running, aren’t we? From our personal experience what gets the event running are the most common things: Guarding a door, collecting bottle/trash, washing dishes in the angel kitchen, being on standby to hop in when spontaneous help is needed or check the wrist band at the entrance.

If there are any further questions about angeltypes, the description of the angeltype usually includes contact data such as a DECT number or an e-mail address that can be used. Alternatively, you can also ask one of the persons of the respective angeltype mentioned under "Supporter".

## [Teams](https://angelguide.c3heaven.de/#_teams)

Congress is organized from different teams, each with its own area of expertise.

All teams are self-organized and provide their own set of services to the event. 

Teams spawn into existence by a need not fulfilled. They are seldom created by an authority.

Check out the [different teams](https://angelguide.c3heaven.de/#_teams) to see which one suits you best.


[Some poeple](https://jascha.wtf/angels-at-chaos-about-volunteering-and-fitting-in/) suggest not to try to fit into special roles at your first event. The roles will find you – not the other way around. Our com­mu­ni­ty is not about per­so­nal gro­wing but about con­tri­bu­ting to each other and gro­wing by doing this. 

## Perks

Being an angel also comes with some perks. While we hope that participation is reward enough, here is a list of things that are exclusive to angels:

- Community acknowledgement
- Hanging out in Heaven and the angel hack center with its chill out area
- Free coffee and (sparkling) water
- Warm drinks or similar to make the cold night shifts more bearable

## Rewards

If you have contributed a certain amount of time, you may receive access to:

- Fantastic hot vegan and vegetarian meals
- The famous limited™ angel T-shirt in Congress design
- Maybe some other perks
