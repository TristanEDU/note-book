[Singer](https://www.singer.io/) is an open-source standard for writing scripts that move data.

It describes how data extraction scripts—called “taps” —and data loading scripts—called “targets”— should communicate, allowing them to be used in any combination to move data from any source to any destination. Send data between databases, web APIs, files, queues, and just about anything else you can think of.

It has many "taps" and "targets" that can help you interact with third party tools without needing to write the code.
