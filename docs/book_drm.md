To remove the DRM from ebooks you can use [DeDRM_tools](https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools).

# Installation

You need to download [the latest release](https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools/releases), and follow the instructions of the README.md of the zip file.o

# Usage

Once the plugin is installed, you can import the books you want to remove the DRM from. In theory the plugin only works on import and not on convert, but I've also used the convert tool to make sure it's a different file.
