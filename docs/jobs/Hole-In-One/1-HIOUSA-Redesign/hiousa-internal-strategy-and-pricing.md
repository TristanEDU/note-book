title: HIOUSA Quote Structure â€“ Rebuild + Retainer
---

## Purpose
To define the final internal pricing and packaging strategy for quoting the HIOUSA.com rebuild and ongoing support retainer.

## Rebuild Quote (One-Time Project)
**Flat Rate:** $2,400 â€“ $3,000

**Included Scope:**
- New site build using Elementor on fresh WordPress install
- Full migration of content and visual replication (with optional modernization)
- Retain Quick Quotes component as-is (integration is external and out-of-scope)
- Responsive, fast, and stable site build
- Accessibility and performance best practices
- No SEO services offered beyond standard best practices (clean HTML, semantic structure, readable layout)

## Retainer Quote (Ongoing Support)
See: [hiousa-retainer-model.md](./hiousa-retainer-model.md)

### Add-On Strategy
- Offer a 10% discount on rebuild if client commits to a 3-month retainer (any tier)
- This provides an incentive to move into long-term partnership without pressure

## Upsell Positioning
- Support across Odds On Promotions blog (currently dated, visually inconsistent)
- Divi site launch assistance for HIOI
- Documented backup, plugin testing, content expansion, responsive tuning

## Internal Notes
- Keep retainer hours generous to ensure perceived value
- Never refer to this as SEO work â€” only structural best practices
- Premium tier should match or exceed the rebuild quality standard

## Questions (Open)
- Does the client prefer flat rate or would milestone-based billing be more appropriate?
- Should we require a discovery deposit before rebuild begins?

title: HIOUSA Rebuild â€“ Strategic Overview
---

## Purpose
This note outlines the high-level goals and overall project rationale for rebuilding the HIOUSA.com website and establishing a long-term development partnership with Prize Indemnity Holdings (PIH) across multiple brand sites.

## Objective
To rebuild HIOUSA.com from scratch and create a technical relationship structure that includes multi-tiered retainer options for long-term support and brand-wide digital stability.

## Project Scope Summary
- Rebuild HIOUSA.com using Elementor on a clean WordPress install
- Modernize the visual design where possible, if approved by the client
- Decommission existing site entirely (too clunky and unstable for updates)
- Preserve Quick Quotes integration placeholder (Amazon backend system, out-of-scope)
- Align with Amy Fanter and David Beboutâ€™s internal workflow (WP Engine + staged environments)
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness, clean architecture, and maintainability

## Strategic Rationale
- Existing site is built with legacy themes (Flat Bootstrap) and overloaded plugins
- Custom code and offshore development have introduced stability issues
- Frequent disappearing CSS files after cache clears and plugin updates
- Better long-term ROI comes from rebuilding on a clean foundation than continually patching

## Long-Term Objective
This rebuild is designed to:
- Establish a working rhythm with Amy (marketing) and David (IT)
- Prove value and reliability as a U.S.-based partner
- Expand into supporting HIOI (Divi-based) and Odds On (blog cleanup)

## Linked Notes
- [hiousa-retainer-model.md](./hiousa-retainer-model.md)
- [hiousa-quote-structure.md](./hiousa-quote-structure.md)

## Questions (Open)
- When will Amy want to start the retainer â€” during or after rebuild?
- How much future support will Quick Quotes require (i.e. future scope?)

## Purpose
To define a sustainable, client-friendly retainer structure for supporting HIOUSA.com, HIOI, and Odds On Promotions after the initial rebuild project is complete.

## Retainer Philosophy
- Retainers are structured as fixed 3-month blocks
- Clients receive a 10% discount on Standard and Premium tiers with a 6-month commitment
- Designed for flexibility, scalability, and long-term client retention
- Hours are intentionally over-delivered relative to cost to encourage client buy-in
- Anchored at psychologically comfortable price points ($375 / $700 / $1200)
- Effective hourly rate ranges from $35â€“$40/hr

## Retainer Tiers
| Tier     | Monthly Fee | Hours Included | Effective Rate | Best For                                            |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic    | $375        | 10 hrs         | $37.50/hr      | Light maintenance, plugin updates, content tweaks   |
| Standard | $700        | 20 hrs         | $35.00/hr      | Ongoing work across brands, layout updates, testing |
| Premium  | $1,200      | 30 hrs         | $40.00/hr      | Heavy dev cycles, Divi site rollout, rapid response |

## All Tiers Include
- Plugin/theme/WordPress updates
- Page edits, layout changes
- Bug fixes, troubleshooting
- WP Engine staging site usage
- Best practices for mobile, accessibility, and performance
- Priority email communication

## Premium Tier Only
- Monthly strategy call
- 10% hour rollover
- Faster turnaround for active projects

## Rationale
- Offers clear entry points for different budget levels
- Encourages commitment without requiring it upfront
- Establishes reliable recurring revenue
- Shows flexibility without undercutting value

## Questions (Open)
- Will Amy want to start with a retainer *during* the rebuild, or post-launch?
