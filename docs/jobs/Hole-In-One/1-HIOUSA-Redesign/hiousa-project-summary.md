#My Aproach <sub>Sorry for not using GPT for this section but it was not giving the correct information</sub>
## My Discoveries
- the site is built with a theme that basicly allows you to drag a drop a text editor and then custom code the particular section of the page.
- there has been more then one change made to the wordpress php files. The one that I think is causing the issues is where they added fonts awsome which according to the client is when the site started having issues.
## My Approach
1. Throughly reviewed site before commiting to anything with client.
2. Determined that a simple patch is not a viable solution. There are just to many issues and it is not worth the clients time or my reputation to try and patch this together.
3. Determined on a strategy to deal with this
	- Propose a site rebuild with limeted support for existing site until the new one is launched (in the initial meeting the client acnowledged that this may be nessary so I think that this will not be a issue)
	- Propose a retainer imidiatly 
###Pricing
**Project Scope:**
- Rebuild the entire site from scratch on a clean WordPress install using **Elementor**
- Maintain existing layout/branding, with optional modernization if desired
- Migrate content and structure into a clean, responsive theme
- Integrate Quick Quotes as a placeholder (no changes to AWS backend)
- Deliver a fast, secure, and stable site on WP Engine‚Äôs infrastructure
- Apply performance and accessibility best practices

**Timeline:** ~2‚Äì3 weeks
**Ownership:** All assets and code transfer fully to you upon payment
**Flat Rate:** $2,400 ‚Äì $3,000

### üîÑ Phase 2: Ongoing Retainer (Optional but Recommended)

| Tier       | Monthly Fee | Hours Included | Notes |
|------------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **Basic**  | $375        | 10 hrs         | Light maintenance, plugin updates |
| **Standard** | $700      | 20 hrs         | Page updates, light design/dev, multi-site coverage |
| **Premium**  | $1,200    | 30 hrs         | Priority access, Divi build support, content overhauls |

**Benefits:**
- WP updates and plugin maintenance
- Staging site support (via WP Engine)
- Layout, copy, and content changes
- Priority response and availability
- Premium includes planning calls and 10% rollover of unused time

### üí° Bundle Offer

- If you commit to any retainer tier for **3 months**, I‚Äôll apply a **10% discount to the rebuild cost**.
- If you commit to either of the uper tier plans for **6 months** I will apply a **10% discount to the retainer**
The hoped for outcome is that she will sign up for the middel tier for 6 months. In light of that I will try and aim for the Premium tier.
