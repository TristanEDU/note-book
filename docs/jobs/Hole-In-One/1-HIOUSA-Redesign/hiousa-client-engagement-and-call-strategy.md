## 🗣️ Key Talking Points

- The existing HIOUSA.com site is bloated and unstable due to both technical debt and legacy practices, and it provides a strong use case for not only a rebuild, but also proactive planning for future upgrades and support across their entire web presence:
  - Legacy theme and deprecated plugins
  - Offshore devs modifying PHP instead of using plugin-based solutions
- Attempting to fix piecemeal would be more time-consuming and fragile than rebuilding
- Elementor provides a clean, client-friendly interface and simplifies future updates
- Everything built is fully transferred to HOI once payment is completed — no lock-in

### Retainer Benefits
- Predictable support with fast turnaround
- No more ad hoc dev searches
- Can support not only HIOUSA, but HIOI (Divi) and Odds On (WordPress blog)
- 3-month minimum; 6-month = 10% discount on Standard/Premium tiers

---

## 🧰 Optional Visual Aids

Prepare to screen-share or reference:
- Plugin list from current HIOUSA site (show legacy issues)
- Example clean Elementor-based build (reference site or layout)
- Retainer tier chart (Basic / Standard / Premium)

---

## 📤 Follow-up Deliverables (Post-Call)

- Proposal (Upwork message or branded PDF)
- Payment request: rebuild milestone or bundled offer
- Onboarding email requesting:
  - WP Engine access
  - WordPress admin credentials
  - Staging details

---

## 🧭 Call Outcome Options

**Ideal Outcome:**
- Client approves rebuild + signs 3- or 6-month retainer
- Sends access details + 50% payment upfront

**Acceptable Outcome:**
- Client requests proposal to review
- Schedules follow-up decision call

## 📄 Proposal for Rebuilding HIOUSA.com + Ongoing Support Retainer

Hi Amy,

Thanks again for the great conversation — I’ve had a chance to look more deeply into the current HIOUSA.com setup, and I’d like to formally propose a clean rebuild combined with a retainer model that gives you ongoing stability, faster support, and full control.

- Migrate content and structure into a clean, responsive theme
- Integrate Quick Quotes as a placeholder (no changes to AWS backend)
- Deliver a fast, secure, and stable site on WP Engine’s infrastructure
- Apply performance and accessibility best practices

**Timeline:** ~2–3 weeks  
**Ownership:** All assets and code transfer fully to you upon payment  
**Flat Rate:** $2,400 – $3,000

| **Standard** | $700      | 20 hrs         | Page updates, light design/dev, multi-site coverage |
| **Premium**  | $1,200    | 30 hrs         | Priority access, Divi build support, content overhauls |

**Benefits:**
- WP updates and plugin maintenance
- Staging site support (via WP Engine)
- Layout, copy, and content changes
- Priority response and availability
- Premium includes planning calls and 10% rollover of unused time

Hi Amy,

It was a pleasure speaking with you — I really appreciate the time and the clear insight you provided on your team’s needs across HIOUSA, HIOI, and Odds On.

As discussed, I recommend we move forward with a clean rebuild of the HIOUSA.com site, paired with a retainer structure that gives you peace of mind and ongoing flexibility. I’ve outlined everything in the attached proposal, including scope, pricing, and a bundling option if you’re open to a 3-month retainer commitment.

### ✅ Next Steps

To get started, here’s what I’ll need from you:

1. **Access**
   - WordPress admin login (or temp admin account)
   - WP Engine staging/dev access (or credentials via your IT contact)

2. **Decision on Retainer**
   - Let me know if you’d like to bundle the rebuild with a retainer tier (Basic, Standard, or Premium)
   - If yes, you’ll receive a 10% discount on the rebuild total

3. **Kickoff**
   - Once confirmed, I’ll request the 50% project deposit via Upwork (or send a separate invoice if preferred)
   - I’ll begin setup in a staging environment and loop in Dave as needed

Let me know if you have any questions at all — I’m happy to adjust timelines or clarify anything in the proposal.

Looking forward to getting started and supporting you moving forward!
