title: HIOUSA UI Design Strategy
---

## 🎯 Core UI Design Focus Areas for HIOUSA.com

---

### 1. Conversion-First Layouts
**Goal:** Drive leads via quotes and inquiries.

- 🟢 Primary CTA in hero: “Get an Instant Quote” button
- 🎯 Sticky header with a contrasting CTA button
- 🧩 Reusable blocks: service highlights, trust badges, testimonials, quote form
- 📋 Multi-step quote modal or inline form (don’t send users to a new page)

**Why it matters:** You're selling prize insurance — not blog posts. The UI should funnel users to the quote action fast, with minimal friction.

---

### 2. Clean, Mobile-Optimized Structure
**Goal:** Mobile-first design with responsive behaviors across breakpoints.

- 🧱 Use a 12-column grid system and clear spacing rules
- 📱 Prioritize thumb-reachable CTAs and simplified navigation
- 📉 Collapse secondary content into accordions or tabs on mobile
- 📐 Use larger fonts and buttons for all form inputs

---

### 3. Trust & Authority Signals
**Goal:** Reassure users that HIOUSA is safe, experienced, and legitimate.

- 🏆 Showcases: “$50M+ in prizes paid”, “17,000+ events covered”
- 🧾 A+ insurance rating badge or underwriter partner info
- ✅ Client logos or “As seen in…” banners
- 🗣 Testimonials with names and organizations

---

### 4. Visual Hierarchy & Simplicity
**Goal:** Guide the user visually — no cognitive overload.

- 🧠 One idea per section; scannable copy
- ✍️ Limit to ~2 typefaces (heading + body)
- 🎨 Strong color contrast for CTAs, subtle neutrals for body sections
- 📏 Consistent margins, padding, and spacing across components

---

### 5. Modular, Scalable Design System
**Goal:** Allow the team (Amy, David, future vendors) to reuse and maintain sections.

- ✅ Pre-designed blocks for:
  - Service highlights
  - Case studies/testimonials
  - Industry-specific landing pages
  - Embedded lead capture forms
- 🧱 Built with Elementor or similar (not hardcoded)

---

### 6. Performance & Accessibility
**Goal:** Ensure fast load times and compliance.

- 🚀 Use lightweight themes (GeneratePress, Astra)
- 🧼 Optimize images and only load essentials
- ♿️ Ensure color contrast, alt text, and keyboard nav
- 🌐 Test using Lighthouse, GTMetrix, and WebPageTest
