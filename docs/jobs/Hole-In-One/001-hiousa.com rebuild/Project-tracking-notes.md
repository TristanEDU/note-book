I have been having a really hard time with the header styling due to the weird and convaluded application of css including a lot of use of the `!important` tag... I actually built a google exstinsion to help me visulize it. 
okay after a lot of trial and error I was able to get the purely asthetic part of the header looking correct. Now I need to get the drop down to style right and the buttons

Ok got it now I am on to the footer.
I am wrapping up with the footer for the evening. I have the basic layout setup but am having some trouble with the social icons

## üîÄ Transition to Milestone 4: Rebuild Core Pages

You are now beginning the page-by-page rebuild process.  
Let me know when you want to:
- Log your first completed page(s)
- Break down Milestone 4 into a live checklist
- Start QA passes on mobile/responsive versions

I am working on the custom quotes plugin right now. I am trying to figure out how to get it to apply. I was able to find the js document for it `quick-quotes-embed.min.js` and upload to to the root of the hiousadev site but I can not get it to apply for some reason. I am currently working with the custom html elementor block and am using the samecode that they used I though but for whatever reason I can not get it working...

## üìù Embedding the HIOUSA Quick Quote Form in Elementor

### üîß How It Works
The `quick-quotes-embed.min.js` script initializes a **Web Component** called `<hio-quick-quote>`. This component renders a fully interactive quote request form powered by Angular.

### üß© Required HTML
To embed the form in Elementor (Free version):

```html
<hio-quick-quote sitekey="58cd8cf3-ab56-4af7-8cd4-ad62b83d9032"></hio-quick-quote>
<script src="https://hiousa.com/quick-quotes-embed.min.js"></script>
```

- Use the Elementor **HTML widget** to paste this code.
- The `sitekey` is essential; it links the form to the correct backend API.
- You **do not** need any `#quick-quote-container` div.

### üí° Notes
- This is a **Web Component**, not a normal JavaScript form injection.
- The script looks for the `<hio-quick-quote>` tag and mounts the form inside it.
- Styling and layout can be controlled using Elementor sections and wrapping the component in a styled `<div>`.

### ‚úÖ Example with Centering
```html
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <hio-quick-quote sitekey="58cd8cf3-ab56-4af7-8cd4-ad62b83d9032"></hio-quick-quote>
</div>
<script src="https://hiousa.com/quick-quotes-embed.min.js"></script>
```

### üß™ Troubleshooting
- Confirm the script URL returns a valid file (no 404).
- If the form doesn‚Äôt render, open DevTools ‚Üí Console and check for JS errors.
- The form **must be placed on the page before the script loads**, or re-init logic must be added manually.

---

_Last verified working on the new Elementor-based rebuild at `hiousadev.wpenginepowered.com`._

The long and short of it is that eventually I got the form working but it took a minute. Now I just have to figure out how styles are being applied it. According to the inspector it is from index in the root folder on line 125 for the header color... when I try to look at it from the devtools though it says it is unavailible and not cached... I will try to look in filezilla and see what I can find.

Recreate the embedded Angular-based quote form from the original Hole-In-One USA website (`hiousa.com`) in a modern Elementor-based environment (`hiousadev.wpenginepowered.com`) using Elementor Free and UAE Header Footer Builder ‚Äî achieving **pixel-perfect accuracy** and maintaining **functional parity** without compromising WordPress theme stability.

---

## üîç Original Source

### üì¶ Script-Based Embedding

The quote form is embedded using the following directive:

```html
<hio-quick-quote sitekey="58cd8cf3-ab56-4af7-8cd4-ad62b83d9032"></hio-quick-quote>
<script src="https://hiousa.com/quick-quotes-embed.min.js"></script>
```

* The script `quick-quotes-embed.min.js` loads and renders a shadow-like Angular component.
* DOM elements and internal styles are injected dynamically.
* Styling is not isolated to a stylesheet but is instead procedurally applied via script execution.

---

## ‚ùó Challenges Faced

### 1. **Dynamically Generated HTML**

* The form markup is not present in the WordPress editor or Elementor backend.
* Elements like `.nav-tabs`, `.form-group`, `.form-control`, and `.btn-quote` are dynamically injected after the script executes.

### 2. **Minified and Embedded Styling**

* All form-related styling is injected via `quick-quotes-embed.min.js`, which contains both logic and styles.
* Traditional DevTools CSS file tracing showed `(index):138`, indicating inline or JS-appended stylesheets.

### 3. **Style Extraction Difficulty**

* Using `getComputedStyle` alone returned all browser-computed values ‚Äî even inherited/default values ‚Äî leading to extremely verbose, low-value output.
* Resulting style dumps were unmanageable: 500+ lines of irrelevant or redundant styles.

### 4. **Elementor Limitations**

* Elementor Free does not allow full HTML control inside templates.
* Solution needed to rely entirely on scoped CSS using Elementor's HTML widget or Site Settings ‚Üí Custom CSS.

---

## üß™ Strategy + Solution

### üîß Phase 1: DOM Capture and Comparison

* Inspected the fully rendered form via DevTools after `quick-quotes-embed.min.js` loaded.
* Captured complete DOM output of the form using `document.querySelector('hio-quick-quote').innerHTML`.
* Cross-referenced the **old site (hiousa.com)** and **new site (hiousadev.wpenginepowered.com)** side-by-side.

### üîç Phase 2: Smart CSS Extraction

#### Scripts Used:

**Initial script**

```js
// Logged full computed styles
const elements = document.querySelectorAll('hio-quick-quote *');
elements.forEach(el => {
  const styles = window.getComputedStyle(el);
  console.log(el.tagName, el.className, styles);
});
```

**Refined script**

```js
// Compare each element against a clean clone to get only effective styles
function getEffectiveStyles(el) {
  const defaultEl = document.createElement(el.tagName);
  document.body.appendChild(defaultEl);
  const computed = window.getComputedStyle(el);
  const baseline = window.getComputedStyle(defaultEl);

  const diff = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < computed.length; i++) {
    const key = computed[i];
    if (computed.getPropertyValue(key) !== baseline.getPropertyValue(key)) {
      diff[key] = computed.getPropertyValue(key);
    }
  }
  defaultEl.remove();
  return diff;
}
```

### üìä Phase 3: CSS Analysis + Prioritization

* Focused only on:

  * Layout styles (widths, flex, margins, paddings)
  * Input styles (font, spacing, borders)
  * Button styles (color, hover, alignment)
  * Tab styles (`.nav-tabs`, `.nav-link.active`)

* Excluded all default tag styles (e.g. inherited line-height, overflow, etc.)

* Bundled computed CSS into `quote-form-effective-styles.json`

---

## üé® Final CSS Solution

Scoped styling applied only within the `hio-quick-quote` component:

```css
hio-quick-quote .quick-quotes-app {
  background: rgba(240, 247, 252, 0.85);
}

hio-quick-quote .form-container,
hio-quick-quote .quote-form-title,
hio-quick-quote .quote-management {
  padding-left: 32px;
  padding-right: 32px;
  margin-left: 32px;
  margin-right: 32px;
}

hio-quick-quote .quote-form-title {
  background-color: #d02b2f !important;
  color: #fff;
}

hio-quick-quote .btn-quote {
  background-color: #d02b2f !important;
  color: #fff !important;
}

hio-quick-quote .form-control,
hio-quick-quote .form-control-select {
  height: auto !important;
}

hio-quick-quote label {
  margin: 0.96rem 0;
  font-size: 15px;
}

.nav-tabs {
  display: flex;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #dee2e6;
  margin-bottom: 30px;
  min-height: 50px;
}

.nav-fill .nav-item {
  flex: 1 1 auto;
  text-align: center;
}

.nav-tabs .nav-item {
  margin-bottom: -1px;
}

.nav-tabs .nav-link {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  padding: 14px 30px;
  font-size: 16px;
  height: auto !important;
  background-color: #f1f1f1;
  border: 1px solid transparent;
  border-top-left-radius: 0.25rem;
  border-top-right-radius: 0.25rem;
}

.nav-tabs .nav-link.active {
  background-color: #fff;
  border-color: #dee2e6 #dee2e6 #fff;
  color: #000;
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Final Outcome

* Achieved pixel-perfect replication of the original quote form
* Scoped CSS avoids global impact across the site
* No plugin dependency or custom Elementor extensions required
* All changes are maintainable and inline-editable from within the Elementor environment

### 2025-06-04 ‚Äì 19:27 PT ‚Äì Home Page Content Added

- The entire homepage structure has now been rebuilt inside Elementor, matching the original layout from hiousa.com section by section. All primary content blocks have been recreated using Elementor‚Äôs default widgets ‚Äî including text, images, callouts, headings, and divider elements. This includes the hero image and tagline, coverage and prize explanation blocks, visual separators, testimonial area, and the final contact call-to-action. As of this point, all visible content that was part of the original homepage is now present in the rebuild.

- Special care was taken to ensure that no custom code or unnecessary plugins were introduced during this process. The structure is built entirely using native Elementor widgets to keep things as lightweight and maintainable as possible. This will also ensure future updates to Elementor and UAE remain compatible. All media files used on the homepage were uploaded earlier in the project and are now properly placed in their respective sections. The image sizes and positions are currently unstyled and will need to be adjusted during the layout phase.

- The current state of the homepage is content-complete but visually unstyled. Typography is using Elementor‚Äôs system defaults (not Myriad Pro), and spacing between elements has not yet been aligned to the legacy site. All button widgets are present but need padding, font, and color adjustments. None of the global styles have been applied yet ‚Äî colors, fonts, and responsive behavior are all pending. There is no animation or motion on scroll, and mobile responsiveness has not yet been addressed. The layout currently looks functional in desktop preview mode but does not visually match the original pixel-for-pixel.

- The next phase will focus entirely on styling and refinement. The layout spacing will be adjusted to match the visual rhythm of the original site, and global styles will be applied for typography and color. Each section will be restyled individually, with attention to margin, padding, alignment, and font consistency. Mobile views will be addressed after desktop styling is finalized. Once the homepage is visually complete, we‚Äôll move on to rebuilding the other core pages using the same system of structured, code-free Elementor blocks.


I would like to note that it would be a good idea to properly style the form at its source instead of using `!important` like we have had too. Below is the finel version of the code that I putin `Apearence > Customize > Custom CSS`

```/* ===============================

/* Adjust margin for error icon display */
hio-quick-quote .quick-quotes-app .material-icons.md-error {
    margin-top: 20px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}

/* Add top padding to date field column */

##6/10/25
I am currently working on the partners page for the site. I was able to figure out getting the correct font Myriad pro. See [the note were I detail how](../../../web-design/adobe-phonts-hack.md) for details as to how I did this. There are quite a few unexspected issues with the site and design practices that are making rebuilding it extremly diffucult. For example the first paragraph section on [the partners page](https://hiousa.com/partners/) used two different paragraph sections at the bottom just for spacing and the bottome border. It is a utter nightmare. Also there is very little of what could be called global styling outside of the font family and the border colors. I am currently working on the section directly below... We will see how it goes...![I am tring to build out this section](assets/partners-page-section.png)
