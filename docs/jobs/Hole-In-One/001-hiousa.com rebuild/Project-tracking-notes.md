### 2025-05-29 – Project Update

**Focus:** Finalized site audit and layout scope for rebuild

#### ✅ Completed Tasks
- Full site map documented and categorized
- Grouped pages by layout type (unique, standard, reusable)
- Clarified scope of PGA section rebuild and prize package page

#### 🔄 In Progress
- Preparing WP Engine Dev environment (Milestone 2)

#### 📌 Next Steps
- Begin Milestone 2: Environment Setup
- Create base Elementor template for PGA section pages
- Review layout of `prize-package-ideas/` for standalone styling

---

## 📄 Final Page Layout Summary

### 🔹 Unique Layouts (10 Pages)
- `/` (Home)
- `/hole-in-one-insurance/`
- `/putting-contest-insurance/`
- `/million-dollar-shootout/`
- `/sponsor-tee-signs/`
- `/contest-insurance/`
- `/faq-hole-one-insurance/`
- `/contact-us/`
- `/privacy-policy/`
- `/partners/` (hub page)

### 🔸 Reused Layout: Standard Affiliate Pages (~8)
- e.g. `/partners/toyota-lexus/`, `/partners/honda-acura-emall/`

### 🔸 Reused Layout: PGA Section Pages (25)
- `/partners/*pga-section/`  
- All require identical structure  
- Only per-page **API key** + **logo** differ  
- Will use a **base Elementor template**

### ⚠️ Non-Standard Pages (4)
- `/partners/marketcenter/`
- `/partners/topgolf/`
- Others with non-repeating structure

### ➕ Independent Content Page
- `/prize-package-ideas/` is a standalone page  
  - It’s **linked from multiple pages** but has its **own layout**

---

## ✅ Scope Clarifications

- Anchor links (e.g. `#Auto_Dealers_Association`) are part of `/partners/` and **not separate pages** — no rebuild required.
- All **PGA pages** will be rebuilt using a **shared template**; only small dynamic edits needed per page.
- `prize-package-ideas/` is treated as a **standalone content page**, not a reusable section.

##Random non gpt notes
9:50 PST I used “Export Media Library” by Mass Edge Inc. to export the entire media library from the staging env while I am waiting for the dev env to finesh reseting. I exported them as a zip file to my local downloads.
The current system uses Quick Rdirects plugin to manage all of its redirects so I exported all of the redirects as a PIPE seperated text file again I sent this to my downloads folder.

I am working on the header template right now. I had to add the other header pages to get them to show. 
- header max height 135px
- nav bar 
I have been having a really hard time with the header styling due to the weird and convaluded application of css including a lot of use of the `!important` tag... I actually built a google exstinsion to help me visulize it. 
okay after a lot of trial and error I was able to get the purely asthetic part of the header looking correct. Now I need to get the drop down to style right and the buttons

Ok got it now I am on to the footer.
I am wrapping up with the footer for the evening. I have the basic layout setup but am having some trouble with the social icons

## 🔀 Transition to Milestone 4: Rebuild Core Pages

You are now beginning the page-by-page rebuild process.  
Let me know when you want to:
- Log your first completed page(s)
- Break down Milestone 4 into a live checklist
- Start QA passes on mobile/responsive versions

I am working on the custom quotes plugin right now. I am trying to figure out how to get it to apply. I was able to find the js document for it `quick-quotes-embed.min.js` and upload to to the root of the hiousadev site but I can not get it to apply for some reason. I am currently working with the custom html elementor block and am using the samecode that they used I though but for whatever reason I can not get it working...

## 📝 Embedding the HIOUSA Quick Quote Form in Elementor

### 🔧 How It Works
The `quick-quotes-embed.min.js` script initializes a **Web Component** called `<hio-quick-quote>`. This component renders a fully interactive quote request form powered by Angular.

### 🧩 Required HTML
To embed the form in Elementor (Free version):

```html
<hio-quick-quote sitekey="58cd8cf3-ab56-4af7-8cd4-ad62b83d9032"></hio-quick-quote>
<script src="https://hiousa.com/quick-quotes-embed.min.js"></script>
```

- Use the Elementor **HTML widget** to paste this code.
- The `sitekey` is essential; it links the form to the correct backend API.
- You **do not** need any `#quick-quote-container` div.

### 💡 Notes
- This is a **Web Component**, not a normal JavaScript form injection.
- The script looks for the `<hio-quick-quote>` tag and mounts the form inside it.
- Styling and layout can be controlled using Elementor sections and wrapping the component in a styled `<div>`.

### ✅ Example with Centering
```html
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <hio-quick-quote sitekey="58cd8cf3-ab56-4af7-8cd4-ad62b83d9032"></hio-quick-quote>
</div>
<script src="https://hiousa.com/quick-quotes-embed.min.js"></script>
```

### 🧪 Troubleshooting
- Confirm the script URL returns a valid file (no 404).
- If the form doesn’t render, open DevTools → Console and check for JS errors.
- The form **must be placed on the page before the script loads**, or re-init logic must be added manually.

---

_Last verified working on the new Elementor-based rebuild at `hiousadev.wpenginepowered.com`._

The long and short of it is that eventually I got the form working but it took a minute. Now I just have to figure out how styles are being applied it. According to the inspector it is from index in the root folder on line 125 for the header color... when I try to look at it from the devtools though it says it is unavailible and not cached... I will try to look in filezilla and see what I can find.

# 🧾 Quote Form Style Extraction and Replication – Full Documentation

## 🧭 Objective

Recreate the embedded Angular-based quote form from the original Hole-In-One USA website (`hiousa.com`) in a modern Elementor-based environment (`hiousadev.wpenginepowered.com`) using Elementor Free and UAE Header Footer Builder — achieving **pixel-perfect accuracy** and maintaining **functional parity** without compromising WordPress theme stability.

---

## 🔍 Original Source

### 📦 Script-Based Embedding

The quote form is embedded using the following directive:

```html
<hio-quick-quote sitekey="58cd8cf3-ab56-4af7-8cd4-ad62b83d9032"></hio-quick-quote>
<script src="https://hiousa.com/quick-quotes-embed.min.js"></script>
```

* The script `quick-quotes-embed.min.js` loads and renders a shadow-like Angular component.
* DOM elements and internal styles are injected dynamically.
* Styling is not isolated to a stylesheet but is instead procedurally applied via script execution.

## ❗ Challenges Faced

### 1. **Dynamically Generated HTML**

* The form markup is not present in the WordPress editor or Elementor backend.
* Elements like `.nav-tabs`, `.form-group`, `.form-control`, and `.btn-quote` are dynamically injected after the script executes.

### 2. **Minified and Embedded Styling**

* All form-related styling is injected via `quick-quotes-embed.min.js`, which contains both logic and styles.
* Traditional DevTools CSS file tracing showed `(index):138`, indicating inline or JS-appended stylesheets.

### 3. **Style Extraction Difficulty**

* Using `getComputedStyle` alone returned all browser-computed values — even inherited/default values — leading to extremely verbose, low-value output.
* Resulting style dumps were unmanageable: 500+ lines of irrelevant or redundant styles.

### 4. **Elementor Limitations**

* Elementor Free does not allow full HTML control inside templates.
* Solution needed to rely entirely on scoped CSS using Elementor's HTML widget or Site Settings → Custom CSS.

---

## 🧪 Strategy + Solution

### 🔧 Phase 1: DOM Capture and Comparison

* Inspected the fully rendered form via DevTools after `quick-quotes-embed.min.js` loaded.
* Captured complete DOM output of the form using `document.querySelector('hio-quick-quote').innerHTML`.
* Cross-referenced the **old site (hiousa.com)** and **new site (hiousadev.wpenginepowered.com)** side-by-side.

### 🔍 Phase 2: Smart CSS Extraction

#### Scripts Used:

**Initial script**

```js
// Logged full computed styles
const elements = document.querySelectorAll('hio-quick-quote *');
elements.forEach(el => {
  const styles = window.getComputedStyle(el);
  console.log(el.tagName, el.className, styles);
});
```

**Refined script**

```js
// Compare each element against a clean clone to get only effective styles
function getEffectiveStyles(el) {
  const defaultEl = document.createElement(el.tagName);
  document.body.appendChild(defaultEl);
  const computed = window.getComputedStyle(el);
  const baseline = window.getComputedStyle(defaultEl);

  const diff = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < computed.length; i++) {
    const key = computed[i];
    if (computed.getPropertyValue(key) !== baseline.getPropertyValue(key)) {
      diff[key] = computed.getPropertyValue(key);
    }
  }
  defaultEl.remove();
  return diff;
}
```

### 📊 Phase 3: CSS Analysis + Prioritization

* Focused only on:

  * Layout styles (widths, flex, margins, paddings)
  * Input styles (font, spacing, borders)
  * Button styles (color, hover, alignment)
  * Tab styles (`.nav-tabs`, `.nav-link.active`)

* Excluded all default tag styles (e.g. inherited line-height, overflow, etc.)

* Bundled computed CSS into `quote-form-effective-styles.json`

---

## 🎨 Final CSS Solution

Scoped styling applied only within the `hio-quick-quote` component:

```css
hio-quick-quote .quick-quotes-app {
  background: rgba(240, 247, 252, 0.85);
}

hio-quick-quote .form-container,
hio-quick-quote .quote-form-title,
hio-quick-quote .quote-management {
  padding-left: 32px;
  padding-right: 32px;
  margin-left: 32px;
  margin-right: 32px;
}

hio-quick-quote .quote-form-title {
  background-color: #d02b2f !important;
  color: #fff;
}

hio-quick-quote .btn-quote {
  background-color: #d02b2f !important;
  color: #fff !important;
}

hio-quick-quote .form-control,
hio-quick-quote .form-control-select {
  height: auto !important;
}

hio-quick-quote label {
  margin: 0.96rem 0;
  font-size: 15px;
}

.nav-tabs {
  display: flex;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #dee2e6;
  margin-bottom: 30px;
  min-height: 50px;
}

.nav-fill .nav-item {
  flex: 1 1 auto;
  text-align: center;
}

.nav-tabs .nav-item {
  margin-bottom: -1px;
}

.nav-tabs .nav-link {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  padding: 14px 30px;
  font-size: 16px;
  height: auto !important;
  background-color: #f1f1f1;
  border: 1px solid transparent;
  border-top-left-radius: 0.25rem;
  border-top-right-radius: 0.25rem;
}

.nav-tabs .nav-link.active {
  background-color: #fff;
  border-color: #dee2e6 #dee2e6 #fff;
  color: #000;
}
```

---

## ✅ Final Outcome

* Achieved pixel-perfect replication of the original quote form
* Scoped CSS avoids global impact across the site
* No plugin dependency or custom Elementor extensions required
* All changes are maintainable and inline-editable from within the Elementor environment

### 2025-06-04 – 19:27 PT – Home Page Content Added

- The entire homepage structure has now been rebuilt inside Elementor, matching the original layout from hiousa.com section by section. All primary content blocks have been recreated using Elementor’s default widgets — including text, images, callouts, headings, and divider elements. This includes the hero image and tagline, coverage and prize explanation blocks, visual separators, testimonial area, and the final contact call-to-action. As of this point, all visible content that was part of the original homepage is now present in the rebuild.

- Special care was taken to ensure that no custom code or unnecessary plugins were introduced during this process. The structure is built entirely using native Elementor widgets to keep things as lightweight and maintainable as possible. This will also ensure future updates to Elementor and UAE remain compatible. All media files used on the homepage were uploaded earlier in the project and are now properly placed in their respective sections. The image sizes and positions are currently unstyled and will need to be adjusted during the layout phase.

- The current state of the homepage is content-complete but visually unstyled. Typography is using Elementor’s system defaults (not Myriad Pro), and spacing between elements has not yet been aligned to the legacy site. All button widgets are present but need padding, font, and color adjustments. None of the global styles have been applied yet — colors, fonts, and responsive behavior are all pending. There is no animation or motion on scroll, and mobile responsiveness has not yet been addressed. The layout currently looks functional in desktop preview mode but does not visually match the original pixel-for-pixel.

- The next phase will focus entirely on styling and refinement. The layout spacing will be adjusted to match the visual rhythm of the original site, and global styles will be applied for typography and color. Each section will be restyled individually, with attention to margin, padding, alignment, and font consistency. Mobile views will be addressed after desktop styling is finalized. Once the homepage is visually complete, we’ll move on to rebuilding the other core pages using the same system of structured, code-free Elementor blocks.


I would like to note that it would be a good idea to properly style the form at its source instead of using `!important` like we have had too. Below is the finel version of the code that I putin `Apearence > Customize > Custom CSS`

```/* ===============================

    margin-top: 0.96rem;

/* Adjust margin for error icon display */

    margin-top: 20px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}

/* Add top padding to date field column */
hio-quick-quote div.form-group.col.date {

##6/10/25
I am currently working on the partners page for the site. I was able to figure out getting the correct font Myriad pro. See [the note were I detail how](../../../web-design/adobe-phonts-hack.md) for details as to how I did this. There are quite a few unexspected issues with the site and design practices that are making rebuilding it extremly diffucult. For example the first paragraph section on [the partners page](https://hiousa.com/partners/) used two different paragraph sections at the bottom just for spacing and the bottome border. It is a utter nightmare. Also there is very little of what could be called global styling outside of the font family and the border colors. I am currently working on the section directly below... We will see how it goes...![I am tring to build out this section](assets/partners-page.png)

I will need to go back through and check all the links with a fine tooth comb. Right now I know that there are both styling and direction errors

I am trying to figuer out how to build this drop down in elementor... there is not a native dropdown for it so I will likely have to build a manual one...![the dropdown](assets/partners-dropdown.png)


I think I can use the acordian deal from elementor. It seems like it will work prettly well.

It is working great I just need to complet the content and the dropdowns

### 2025-06-04 – 21:42 PT – Core Page Rebuilds Nearly Complete (2 Pages Remaining)

- All major pages from **Home** through **Partners** have been rebuilt in Elementor, replicating the structure, content, and layout of the original site.
- Rebuilt pages include: 
  Home, Hole-in-One Insurance, Prize Package Ideas, Putting Contest, Million Dollar Shootout, Sponsor Tee Signs, Contest Insurance, FAQ, Privacy Policy, Contact, and Partners.
- The final two pages are still in progress and will complete the Phase 3 core rebuild milestone once finished.
- All pages are constructed using clean Elementor and UAE components — no custom CSS has been introduced.
- Visual structure is consistent and well-aligned with the legacy design.
- Global font and spacing rules are semi-consistent, but the final pass for typography, padding, button styles, and spacing is still pending.
- Internal and external links still need to be placed or re-verified across all pages.
- Quote form placeholders are in place on relevant pages, pending integration.
- Mobile responsiveness is partially addressed but will require a full device pass before final QA.

**Next Steps:**
- Finish rebuilding the final 2 pages
- Add all missing links across existing pages
- Complete final styling (font sizes, spacing, button appearance)
- Begin templating the Partner Pages (Phase 4)


I am working on finding a way to export the old contact form from the stg site and use that in the new setup. I think that the best way to do it is to just manually copy all the old form code and paste it into the new enviroment. This unfourtunatly does not bring images or other such dependencies such as styling with it however so I will likly have to add that to the custom code section. It is also likly that that I will need to install and setup the other various contact form 7 plugins that were in the old site however I am hoping to avoid that if I can. [the contact page](assets/old-contact-page.png)

##GPTs Instructions
The following is GPTs instructions for recreating the layout and styling in elementor

Would you like a downloadable `.json` Elementor template file for this layout too (Pro version only)?

I am having a devil of a time properly styling the contact form however I did just find the theme editible [css file](assets/old-sites-css.txt) I think That I might go batty trying to figure this all out...
