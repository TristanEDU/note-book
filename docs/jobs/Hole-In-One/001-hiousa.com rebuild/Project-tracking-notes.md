- `/sponsor-tee-signs/`
- `/contest-insurance/`

- `/partners/*pga-section/`  
- All require identical structure  
- Only per-page **API key** + **logo** differ  
- Will use a **base Elementor template**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Non-Standard Pages (4)
- `/partners/marketcenter/`

- All **PGA pages** will be rebuilt using a **shared template**; only small dynamic edits needed per page.

##Random non gpt notes
9:50 PST I used ‚ÄúExport Media Library‚Äù by Mass Edge Inc. to export the entire media library from the staging env while I am waiting for the dev env to finesh reseting. I exported them as a zip file to my local downloads.
The current system uses Quick Rdirects plugin to manage all of its redirects so I exported all of the redirects as a PIPE seperated text file again I sent this to my downloads folder.

##UAE Header
I am working on the header template right now. I had to add the other header pages to get them to show. 
- header max height 135px
- nav bar 
I have been having a really hard time with the header styling due to the weird and convaluded application of css including a lot of use of the `!important` tag... I actually built a google exstinsion to help me visulize it. 
okay after a lot of trial and error I was able to get the purely asthetic part of the header looking correct. Now I need to get the drop down to style right and the buttons

Ok got it now I am on to the footer.
I am wrapping up with the footer for the evening. I have the basic layout setup but am having some trouble with the social icons
