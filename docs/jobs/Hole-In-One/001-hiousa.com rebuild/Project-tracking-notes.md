## üìÑ Final Page Layout Summary

### üîπ Unique Layouts (10 Pages)
- `/` (Home)
- `/hole-in-one-insurance/`
- `/putting-contest-insurance/`
- `/million-dollar-shootout/`
- `/sponsor-tee-signs/`
- `/contest-insurance/`
- `/faq-hole-one-insurance/`
- `/contact-us/`
- `/privacy-policy/`
- `/partners/` (hub page)

### üî∏ Reused Layout: Standard Affiliate Pages (~8)
- e.g. `/partners/toyota-lexus/`, `/partners/honda-acura-emall/`

### üî∏ Reused Layout: PGA Section Pages (25)
- `/partners/*pga-section/`  
- All require identical structure  
- Only per-page **API key** + **logo** differ  
- Will use a **base Elementor template**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Non-Standard Pages (4)
- `/partners/marketcenter/`
- `/partners/topgolf/`
- Others with non-repeating structure

### ‚ûï Independent Content Page
- `/prize-package-ideas/` is a standalone page  
  - It‚Äôs **linked from multiple pages** but has its **own layout**

---

## ‚úÖ Scope Clarifications

- Anchor links (e.g. `#Auto_Dealers_Association`) are part of `/partners/` and **not separate pages** ‚Äî no rebuild required.
- All **PGA pages** will be rebuilt using a **shared template**; only small dynamic edits needed per page.
- `prize-package-ideas/` is treated as a **standalone content page**, not a reusable section.
