# On the language itself
## Personal notes on the 38C3 Esperanto gathering
- The language has 130 years
- It's difficult to reform: There is no defined process to change the language and they don't like newbies to propose changes although there is an academy of esperanto
- There are no different past, conditional  tenses
- There is no conjugation, they always use the pronouns
