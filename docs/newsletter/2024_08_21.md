### [questionary](questionary.md)

* New: [Unit testing questionary code.](questionary.md#unit-testing)

    Testing `questionary` code can be challenging because it involves interactive prompts that expect user input. However, there are ways to automate the testing process. You can use libraries like `pexpect`, `pytest`, and `pytest-mock` to simulate user input and test the behavior of your code.
    
    Here’s how you can approach testing `questionary` code using `pytest-mock` to mock `questionary` functions
    
    You can mock `questionary` functions like `questionary.select().ask()` to simulate user choices without actual user interaction.
    
    **Testing a single `questionary.text` prompt**
    
    Let's assume you have a function that asks the user for their name:
    
    ```python
    import questionary
    
    def ask_name() -> str:
        name = questionary.text("What's your name?").ask()
        return name
    ```
    
    You can test this function by mocking the `questionary.text` prompt to simulate the user's input.
    
    ```python
    import pytest
    from your_module import ask_name
    
    def test_ask_name(mocker):
        # Mock the text function to simulate user input
        mock_text = mocker.patch('questionary.text')
    
        # Define the response for the prompt
        mock_text.return_value.ask.return_value = "Alice"
    
        result = ask_name()
    
        assert result == "Alice"
    ```
    
    **Test a function that has many questions**
    
    Here’s an example of how to test a function that contains two `questionary.text` prompts using `pytest-mock`.
    
    Let's assume you have a function that asks for the first and last names of a user:
    
    ```python
    import questionary
    
    def ask_full_name() -> dict:
        first_name = questionary.text("What's your first name?").ask()
        last_name = questionary.text("What's your last name?").ask()
        return {"first_name": first_name, "last_name": last_name}
    ```
    
    You can mock both `questionary.text` calls to simulate user input for both the first and last names:
    
    ```python
    import pytest
    from your_module import ask_full_name
    
    def test_ask_full_name(mocker):
        # Mock the text function for the first name prompt
        mock_text_first = mocker.patch('questionary.text')
        # Define the response for the first name prompt
        mock_text_first.side_effect = ["Alice", "Smith"]
    
        result = ask_full_name()
    
        assert result == {"first_name": "Alice", "last_name": "Smith"}
    ```

    feat(aleph#Get all documents of a collection): Get all documents of a collection
    
    `list_aleph_collection_documents.py` is a Python script designed to interact with an API to
    retrieve and analyze documents from specified collections. It offers a command-line interface
    (CLI) to list and check documents within a specified collection.
    
    **Features**
    
    - Retrieve documents from a specified collection.
    - Analyze document processing statuses and warn if any are not marked as successful.
    - Return a list of filenames from the retrieved documents.
    - Supports verbose output for detailed logging.
    - Environment variable support for API key management.
    
    **Installation**
    
    To install the required dependencies, use `pip`:
    
    ```bash
    pip install typer requests
    ```
    
    Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.

    *Get your API key*
    
    By default, any Aleph search will return only public documents in responses to API requests.
    
    If you want to access documents which are not marked public, you will need to sign into the tool. This can be done through the use on an API key. The API key for any account can be found by clicking on the "Settings" menu item in the navigation menu.
    
    **Usage**
    
    You can run the script directly from the command line. Below are examples of usage:
    
    Retrieve and list documents from a collection:
    
    ```bash
    python list_aleph_collection_documents.py --api-key "your-api-key" 'Name of your collection'
    ```
    
    Using an Environment Variable for the API Key
    
    This is better from a security perspective.
    ```bash
    export API_KEY=your_api_key
    python list_aleph_collection_documents.py 'Name of your collection'
    ```
    
    Enabling Verbose Logging
    
    To enable detailed debug logs, use the `--verbose` or `-v` flag:
    
    ```bash
    python list_aleph_collection_documents.py -v 'Name of your collection'
    ```
    
    Getting help
    
    ```bash
    python list_aleph_collection_documents.py --help
    ```

### [Camelot](camelot.md)

* New: Introduce Camelot.

    [Camelot](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/) is a Python library that can help you extract tables from PDFs
    
    ```python
    import camelot
    
    tables = camelot.read_pdf('foo.pdf')
    
    tables
    <TableList n=1>
    
    tables.export('foo.csv', f='csv', compress=True) # json, excel, html, markdown, sqlite
    
    tables[0]
    <Table shape=(7, 7)>
    
    tables[0].parsing_report
    {
        'accuracy': 99.02,
        'whitespace': 12.24,
        'order': 1,
        'page': 1
    }
    
    tables[0].to_csv('foo.csv') # to_json, to_excel, to_html, to_markdown, to_sqlite
    
    tables[0].df # get a pandas DataFrame!
    ```
    
    **[Installation](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/install.html#install)**
    
    To install Camelot from PyPI using pip, please include the extra cv requirement as shown:
    
    $ pip install "camelot-py[base]"
    
    It requires Ghostscript to be able to use the `lattice` mode. Which is better than using `tabular-py` that requires java to be installed.
    
    **Usage**
    
    **[Process background lines](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/advanced.html#process-background-lines)**
    
    To detect line segments, Lattice needs the lines that make the table to be in the foreground.
    To process background lines, you can pass process_background=True.
    
    tables = camelot.read_pdf('background_lines.pdf', process_background=True)
    
    tables[1].df

### [Bandit](bandit.md)

* New: [Solving warning B603: subprocess_without_shell_equals_true.](bandit.md#b603:-subprocess_without_shell_equals_true)

    The `B603: subprocess_without_shell_equals_true` issue in Bandit is raised when the `subprocess` module is used without setting `shell=True`. Bandit flags this because using `shell=True` can be a security risk if the command includes user-supplied input, as it opens the door to shell injection attacks.
    
    To fix it:
    
    1. Avoid `shell=True` if possible: Instead, pass the command and its arguments as a list to `subprocess.Popen` (or `subprocess.run`, `subprocess.call`, etc.). This way, the command is executed directly without invoking the shell, reducing the risk of injection attacks.
    
       Here's an example:
    
       ```python
       import subprocess
    
       # Instead of this:
       # subprocess.Popen("ls -l", shell=True)
    
       # Do this:
       subprocess.Popen(["ls", "-l"])
       ```
    
    2. When you must use `shell=True`: - If you absolutely need to use `shell=True` (e.g., because you are running a complex shell command or using shell features like wildcards), ensure that the command is either hardcoded or sanitized to avoid security risks.
    
       Example with `shell=True`:
    
       ```python
       import subprocess
    
       # Command is hardcoded and safe
       command = "ls -l | grep py"
       subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)
       ```
    
       If the command includes user input, sanitize the input carefully:
    
       ```python
       import subprocess
    
       user_input = "some_directory"
       command = f"ls -l {subprocess.list2cmdline([user_input])}"
       subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)
       ```
    
       **Note:** Even with precautions, using `shell=True` is risky with user input, so avoid it if possible.
    
    3. Explicitly tell bandit you have considered the risk: If you have reviewed the code and are confident that the code is safe in your particular case, you can mark the line with a `# nosec` comment to tell Bandit to ignore the issue:
    
       ```python
       import subprocess
    
       command = "ls -l | grep py"
       subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)  # nosec
       ```

# Operating Systems

## Linux

### [Linux Snippets](linux_snippets.md)

* Correction: Docker prune without removing the manual networks.

    If you run the command `docker system prune` in conjunction with [watchtower](watchtower.md) and manually defined networks you may run into the issue that the docker system prune acts just when the dockers are stopped and thus removing the networks, which will prevent the dockers to start. In those cases you can either make sure that docker system prune is never run when watchtower is doing the updates or you can split the command into the next script:
    
    ```bash
    
    date
    echo "Pruning the containers"
    docker container prune -f --filter "label!=prune=false"
    echo "Pruning the images"
    docker image prune -f --filter "label!=prune=false"
    echo "Pruning the volumes"
    docker volume prune -f
    ```
