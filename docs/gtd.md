[Getting things done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done), commonly known as GTD is a task management method created by David Allen and published in a book of the same name.
- 
The GTD method rests on the idea of moving all items of interest, relevant information, issues, tasks and projects out of one's mind by recording them externally and then breaking them into actionable work items with known time limits. This allows one's attention to focus on taking action on each task listed in an external record, instead of recalling them intuitively.

# Theory principles

The theory is based on three key objectives: 

* Capturing all the things that might need to get done or have usefulness for you in a logical and trusted system outside your head and off your mind.
* Directing yourself to make front-end decisions about all of the “inputs” you let into your life so that you will always have a workable inventory of “next actions” that you can implement or renegotiate in the moment.
* Curating and coordinating all of that content, utilizing the recognition of the multiple levels of commitments with yourself and others you will have at play, at any point in time.

The idea is to have a system with a coherent set of behaviors and tools that:

* Functions effectively at the level at which work really happens. 
* Incorporates the results of big-picture thinking as well as the smallest of open details. 
* Manage multiple tiers of priorities. 
* Maintains control over hundreds of new inputs daily. 
* Save a lot more time and effort than are needed to maintain it. 
* Allows you to maximize your time "in the zone" or "flowing".

## Managing commitments

Most stress comes from inappropriately managed commitments, every one of them, big or little, is being tracked by a less-than-conscious part of you. These are the “incompletes,” or “open loops,” which are anything pulling at your attention that doesn’t belong where it is, the way it is.

In order to deal effectively with all of that, you must first identify and capture all those things that are “ringing your bell” in some way, clarify what, exactly, they mean to you, and then make a decision about how to move on them.

Managing commitments well requires the implementation of some basic activities and behaviors:

* If it’s on your mind, your mind isn’t clear. Anything you consider unfinished in any way must be captured in a trusted system outside your mind that you know you’ll come back to regularly and sort through.
* You must clarify exactly what your commitment is and decide what you have to do, if anything, to make progress toward fulfilling it.
* Once you’ve decided on all the actions you need to take, you must keep reminders of them organized in a system you review regularly.

These "open loops" make you unreliably think many times on the topic without making any progress. This is a waste of time and energy and only adds to your anxiety about what you should be doing and aren't. There is no reason to ever have the same thought twice, unless you like having that thought.

## Managing stuff

"stuff" is anything you have allowed into your psychological or physical world that doesn’t belong where it is, but for which you haven’t yet determined what, exactly, it means to you, with the desired outcome and the next action step. The reason most organizing systems haven’t worked for most people is that they haven’t yet transformed all the stuff they’re trying to organize. As long as it’s still stuff, it’s not controllable.

Almost all of the to-do lists are merely listings of "stuff", not inventories of the resultant real work that needed to be done. They are partial reminders of a lot of things that are unresolved and as yet untranslated into outcomes and actions. Looking at these often creates more stress than relief, because, though it is a valuable trigger for something that you’ve committed to do or decide something about, it still calls out psychologically, “Decide about me!” And if you do not have the energy or focus at the moment to think and decide, it will simply remind you that you are overwhelmed.

The key to managing all of your stuff is managing your *actions*.

What you do with your time, what you do with information, and what you do with your body and your focus relative to your priorities. Those are the real options to which you must allocate your limited resources. The substantive issue is how to make appropriate choices about what to do at any point in time. The real work is to manage our actions.

## Managing actions

You need to control commitments, projects, and actions in two ways:

* Horizontally: Horizontal control maintains coherence across all the activities in which you are involved. You need a good system that can keep track of as many of them as possible, supply required information about them on demand, and allow you to shift your focus from one thing to the next quickly and easily.
* Vertically: Vertical control, in contrast, manages thinking, development, and coordination of individual topics and projects. This is “project planning” in the broad sense. It’s focusing in on a single endeavor, situation, or person and fleshing out whatever ideas, details, priorities, and sequences of events may be required for you to handle it, at least for the moment.

## Bottom-Up approach

Intellectually, the most appropriate way ought to be to work from the top down, first uncovering personal and organizational purpose and vision, then defining critical objectives, and finally focusing on the details of implementation. The trouble is, however, that most people are so embroiled in commitments on a day-to-day level that their ability to focus successfully on the larger horizon is seriously impaired. Consequently, a bottom-up approach is usually more effective.

## Workflow steps

* [Capture what has our attention.](#capture)
* [Clarify what each item means and what to do about it.](#clarify-and-organize)
* [Organize the results.](#clarify-and-organize)
* [Reflect on the options.](#reflect)
* [Engage the chosen options.](#engage)

### Capture

It’s important to know what needs to be captured and how to do that most effectively so you can process it appropriately. In order for your mind to let go of the lower-level task of trying to hang on to everything, you have to know that you have truly captured everything that might represent something you have to do or at least decide about, and that at some point in the near future you will process and review all of it.

In order to eliminate “holes in your bucket,” you need to collect and gather placeholders for, or representations of, all the things you consider incomplete in your world: anything personal or professional, big or little, of urgent or minor importance, that you think ought to be different than it currently is and that you have any level of internal commitment to changing.

To manage this inventory of open loops appropriately, you need to capture it into “containers” that hold items in abeyance until you have a few moments to decide what they are and what, if anything, you’re going to do about them. Then you must empty these containers regularly to ensure that they remain viable capture tools.

There are several types of tools, both low and high tech, that can be used to collect your open loops. The following can all serve as versions of an in-tray, capturing self-generated input as well as information from external sources:

* Physical in-tray
* Paper-based note-taking devices
* Digital/audio note-taking devices
* E-mail and text messaging

You'll probably need to choose a variety of tools to fulfill the different inputs of your life, these should become part of your lifestyle. Keep them close by so no matter where you are you can collect a potentially valuable thought. You should have as many in-trays as you need and as few as you can get by with. If you have too many collection zones, however, you won’t be able to process them easily or consistently.

That's one of the key points of your capture tools, if you don’t empty and process the stuff you’ve collected, your tools aren’t serving any function other than the storage of amorphous material. Emptying the contents does not mean that you have to finish what’s there; it just means that you have to decide more specifically what it is and what should be done with it, and if it’s still unfinished, organize it into your system. You must get it out of the container. 

In order to get your “inbox” to empty, however, an integrated life-management system must be in place. Too much stuff is left piled in in-trays (physical and digital) because of a lack of effective systems downstream.

### Clarify and organize

This is the component of input management that forms the basis for your personal organisation. It's basically thinking about the item and following the next diagram:

![](gtd-clarify-diagram.png)

Your "stuff" will end in one of the next containers:

* Trash: Throw away, shred, or recycle anything that has no potential future action or reference value. If you leave this stuff mixed in with other categories, it will seriously undermine the system and your clarity in the environment.

* Someday/Maybe: It can be useful and inspiring to maintain an ongoing list of things you might want to do at some point but not now. This is the “parking lot” for projects that would be impossible to move on at present but that you don’t want to forget about entirely. You’d like to be reminded of the possibility at regular intervals (probably on your weekly reviews). You can also think this as the backlog. Here also belongs other types of information that only needs to be reviewed when you have an urge to engage in a particular kind of activity such as lists like books to read, web sites to surf, trips to do, things to do, recipes to try... Only if you want to review them often to expand your options for creative exploration, otherwise they belong to the References.

* References are the rest of information that that requires no action but have intrinsic value as information such as your [digital garden](digital_garden.md) or technical books.

  Reference systems generally take two forms: 

  * Topic and area specific storage: 

  * General reference files: Stores ad hoc information that doesn’t belong in some predesigned larger category. 

* Projects are any desired result that can be accomplished within a year that requires more than one action step. This means that some rather small things you might not normally call projects are going to be on your Projects list, as well as some big ones. If one step won’t complete something, some kind of goalpost needs to be set up to remind you that there’s something still left to do. If you don’t have a placeholder to remind you about it, it will slip back into your head. The reason for the one-year time frame is that anything you are committed to finish within that scope needs to be reviewed weekly to feel comfortable about its status. Another way to think of this is as a list of open loops, no matter what the size.

  Projects do not initially need to be listed in any particular order, by size, or by priority. They just need to be on a master list so you can review them regularly enough to ensure that appropriate next actions have been defined for each of them.

  There may be reasons to sort your projects into different subcategories, based upon different areas of your focus, but initially creating a single list of all of them will make it easier to customize your system appropriately as you get more comfortable with its usage.

  For many of your projects, you will accumulate relevant information that you will want to organize by theme or topic or project name. Your Projects list will be merely an index. All of the details, plans, and supporting information that you may need as you work on your various projects should be contained in your References system, in separate file folders, computer files, notebooks, or binders .

* Waiting for: Tracks the elements that are blocked for any reason, under each element you should add that reason and optionally the process you want to follow to unblock it.
* Next Actions: Tracks any longer-than-two-minute, non-delegatable action you have identified. If you have only twenty or thirty of these, it may be fine to keep them all on one list labeled “Next Actions,” which you’ll review whenever you have any free time. For most of us, however, the number is more likely to be fifty to 150. In that case it makes sense to subdivide your Next Actions list into categories, such as Calls to make when you have a window of time and your phone, or Computer action items to see as options when you’re at that device.

* Calendar: Reminders of actions you need to take fall into two categories: those about things that have to happen on a specific day or time, and those about things that just need to get done as soon as possible. Your calendar handles the first type of reminder.

  These things go on your calendar:

  * Time-Specific actions or appointments.
  * Day-Specific actions: These are things that you need to do sometime on a certain day, but not necessarily at a specific time. 
  * Day-Specific information: Information that may be useful on a certain date. This might include directions for appointments, activities that other people will be involved in then, or events of interest. It’s helpful to put short-term tickler information here, too, such as a reminder to call someone after he or she returns from vacation. This is also where you would want to park important reminders about when something might be due, or when something needs to be started, given a determined lead time.

  Daily to-do lists don't belong to the calendar because:

  * Constant new input and shifting tactical priorities reconfigure daily work so consistently that it’s virtually impossible to nail down to-do items ahead of time. Having a working game plan as a reference point is always useful, but it must be able to be renegotiated at any moment. Trying to keep a list on the calendar, which must then be reentered on another day if items don’t get done, is demoralizing and a waste of time. The Next Actions lists will hold all of those action reminders, even the most time-sensitive ones. And they won’t have to be rewritten daily.

  * If there’s something on a daily to-do list that doesn’t absolutely have to get done that day, it will dilute the emphasis on the things that truly do. The calendar should be sacred territory. If you write something there, it must get done that day or not at all. 

  That said, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with creating a quick, informal, short list of “if I have time, I’d really like to . . .” kinds of things, picked from your Next Actions inventory. It just should not be confused with your “have-tos,” and it should be treated lightly enough to discard or change quickly as the inevitable surprises of the day unfold.

### Reflect

This is where you take a look at all your outstanding projects and open loops. It’s your chance to scan all the defined actions and options before you, thus radically increasing the efficacy of the choices you make about what you’re doing at any point in time.

The item you’ll probably review most frequently is your calendar, which will remind you about what things truly have to be handled that day. This doesn’t mean that the contents there are the most “important” in some grand sense, only that they must get done. At any point in time, knowing what has to get done and when creates a terrain for maneuvering. It’s a good habit, as soon as you conclude an action on your calendar, to check and see what else remains to be done.

Review whatever lists, overviews, and orientation maps you need to, as often as you need to, to get their contents off your mind.

After checking your calendar, you’ll most often turn to your Next Action lists. These hold the inventory of predefined actions that you can take if you have any discretionary time during the day. If you’ve organized them by context (At Home; At Computer; In Meeting with George) they’ll come into play only when those contexts are available.

Projects, Waiting For, and Someday/Maybe lists need to be reviewed only as often as you think they have to be in order to stop you from wondering about them with a minimum recurrence of once each week.

### Engage

The basic purpose of this workflow management process is to facilitate good choices about what you’re doing at any point in time and feel good about it. The idea is to use your intuition on the information you have captured, clarified, organized, and reflected regarding all your current commitments. 

First you need to get an awareness of your state. At any point in time you're limited to do the tasks that meet your:

* Context: Most actions need to be done on a specific location or having some tool at hand. You can use tags to filter the actions available to your context.
* Time available.
* Energy available.

Then you need to decide what type of task you want to do:

* Predefined tasks: Dealing with tasks that you have previously determined need to be done, items of your calendar and Next actions list.
* Unplanned tasks: Often things come up ad hoc, unsuspected and unforeseen that you either have to or choose to engage in as they occur. When you follow these leads, you’re deciding by default that these things are more important than anything else you have to do at those times.
* Managing the task system: This entails following the earlier steps of the workflow: capturing stuff, clarifying, organizing and reflecting. As you process your inputs, you’ll no doubt be taking care of some less-than-two-minute actions and tossing and filing numerous things. A good portion of this activity will consist of identifying things that need to get done sometime, but not right away. You’ll be adding to all of your lists as you go along.

And finally decide which one to do based on your priority. Defining priority is a hard task that often involves looking towards the "big picture". The idea is to scale up the abstraction tree below to help you decide:

* Task level: This is the accumulated list of all the actions you need to take.
* Project level: Group of tasks that share a relatively short-term outcome you want to achieve.
* Area level: These are the key areas of your life within which you want to achieve results and maintain standards such as health, social, learning, home, recreation, finances, etc. These are not things to finish but rather to use as criteria for assessing our experiences and our engagements, to maintain balance and sustainability as we live. Listing and reviewing these responsibilities gives a more comprehensive framework for evaluating your inventory of projects.
* Goal level: What specific achievements you want to meet in the different areas of your life one to two years from now will add another dimension to prioritize your tasks. 
* Vision level: Projecting three to five years into the future generates thinking about bigger categories: organization strategies, environmental trends, career and lifestyle transition circumstances. Internal factors include longer-term career, family, financial, and quality-of-life aspirations and considerations. 
* Purpose and Principles: This is the big-picture view. The primary purpose for anything provides the core definition of what it really is. All goals, visions, objectives, projects, and actions derive from this, and lead toward it.

In real life the important conversations you will have about your focus and your priorities may not exactly fit one level or another. They can provide a useful framework, however, to remind you of the multilayered nature of your commitments and tasks.

Setting priorities in the traditional sense of focusing on your long-term goals and values, though obviously a necessary core focus, does not provide a practical framework for a vast majority of the decisions and tasks you must engage in day to day. Mastering the flow of your work at all the levels you experience that work provides a much more holistic way to get things done and feel good about it.

# Setting up the system

To apply the workflow you need to first set the system up, then you'll be able to use and maintain it. To be able to do it save block of time to initialize this process and prepare a workstation with the appropriate space, furniture, and tools. If your space is properly set up and streamlined, it can reduce your unconscious resistance to dealing with your stuff and even make it attractive for you to sit down and crank through your input and your work. An ideal time frame for most people is two whole days, back to back.

## Setting up the space

Choose a physical location to serve as as your central cockpit of control. If you already have a desk and office space set up where you work, that’s probably the best place to start. If you work from a home office, obviously that will be your prime location. If you already have both, you’ll want to establish identical, even interchangeable systems in both places, though one will probably be primary.

The basics for a workspace are just a writing surface and room for an in-tray.

## Capture all your stuff

The focus of this process is to capture *everything* that has your attention, otherwise some part of you will still not totally trust that you're working with the whole picture. While you're doing it, create a list of all the sources of inputs in your world. 

What you're going to do is methodically go through each piece of your life and search for anything that doesn’t permanently belong where it is, the way it is, and put it into your in-tray. You’ll be gathering things that are incomplete or things that have some decision about potential action tied to them. They all go into your “inbox”, so they’ll be available for later processing.

Be patient, this process may take between 1 and 6 hours, and at the end you'll have a huge pile of stuff in your inbox. You might be scared and get the thought of "what am I doing with my life?", but don't worry you'll get everything in order soon :).

### Define what is going to be your in-tray

To be able to store all the "stuff" that needs to be dealt with you need to define what is your in-tray going to be, some suggestions are:

* A clear room: Make some space somewhere at the location you're going to do the gathering to pile physical stuff
* A physical or digital list.

### Physical gathering

The first activity is to search your physical environment. The best way to create a clean decision about whether something should go into the in-tray is to understand clearly what shouldn’t go in. Here are the four categories of things that can remain where they are, the way they are, with no action tied to them:

* Supplies: Anything you need to keep because you use it regularly. 
* Reference Material: Anything you simply keep for information as needed. This category includes manuals, all your telephone and address information, any material relevant to projects, themes, and topics. It also includes books and magazines that you may be keeping as a library.
* Decoration.
* Equipment: Your phone, computer, printer, wastebasket, furniture, clock, chargers, pens, and notepads.

Everything else goes into your inbox. But many of the things you might initially interpret as supplies, reference, decoration, or equipment could also have action associated with them because they still aren’t exactly the way they need to be.

As you engage in the capturing step, you may run into one or more of the following problems:

* An item is too big to go in the in-tray: create a post it that represents it or add it as an entry in your digital inbox- .

## Decide how to handle the sources of inputs

Now that you know where do your inputs come from you need to think how do you want to manage them from now on to ensure that you're able to be able to continuously capture items in a frictionless way.

## Setting your containers

### Setting up your filing system

You will resist the whole process of capturing information if your reference systems are not fast, functional, and fun. Thus you need to envision a system at hand that supports both physical and digital content. Without a streamlined system for both, you will resist keeping potentially valuable information, or what you do keep will accumulate in inappropriate places. 

We’re concerned here mostly with general-reference filing, anything that you want to keep for its interesting or useful data or purpose and that doesn’t fit into your specialized filing systems and won’t stand up by itself on a shelf. For example articles, brochures, pieces of paper, notes, printouts, documents, and even physical things like tickets, keys, buyers-club membership cards, and flash drives.

It should take you less than one minute to pick something up out of your in-tray, decide it needs no next action but has some potential future value, and finish storing it in a trusted system. If it takes longer, you’ll likely stack it or stuff it somewhere instead. Besides being fast, the system needs to be fun and easy, current and complete. Otherwise you’ll unconsciously resist emptying your in-tray because you know there’s likely to be something in there that ought to get filed, and you won’t even want to look at the papers or your clogged e-mail. If you have to get up every time you have some ad hoc piece of paper you want to file, or you have to search multiple places on your computer for an appropriate location for a piece of information you want to keep, you’ll tend to stack it or leave it in its original place instead of filing it.

You must feel equally comfortable about filing a single piece of paper on a new topic, even a scribbled note, in its own file as you would about filing a more formal, larger document.

Whatever you need to do to get your reference system to that quick and easy standard for everything it has to hold, do it. For example purge your files at least once a year, that keeps it from going stale and becoming the dreaded black hole- .

### Digital general reference

It is very helpful to have a visual map sorted in ways that make sense, either by indexes or data groups organized effectively, usually in an alphabetic order.

The biggest issue for digitally oriented people is that the ease of capturing and storing has generated a write-only syndrome: all they’re doing is capturing information—not actually accessing and using it intelligently. Some consciousness needs to be applied to keep one’s potentially huge digital library functional, versus a black hole of data easily dumped in there with a couple of keystrokes.

You need to consistently check how much room to give yourself so that the content remains meaningfully and easily accessible, without creating a black hole of an inordinate amount of information amorphously organized. 

### Physical general reference

One idea is to have one system/place where you order the content alphabetically, not multiple ones. People have a tendency to want to use their files as a personal management system, and therefore they attempt to organize them in groupings by projects or areas of focus. This magnifies geometrically the number of places something isn’t when you forget where you filed it.

### Physical stuff

# Unclassified thoughts

* There must be zero resistance to using the systems we have. Having to continually reinvent our in-tray, our filing system, and how and where we process our stuff can only be a source of incessant distraction.
* One of the best tricks for enhancing your productivity is having organizing tools you love to use.

## The weekly review

The Weekly Review is the time to:

* Gather and process all your stuff.
* Review your system.
* Update your lists.
* Get clean, clear, current, and complete.
