## [Wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpgancio/)

This plugin allows you to embed a list of events or a single event from your Gancio website using a shortcode.
It also allows you to connects a Gancio instance to a your wordpress website to automatically push events published on WordPress:
for this to work an event manager plugin is required, Event Organiser and The Events Calendar are supported. Adding another plugin itâ€™s an easy task and you have a guide available in the repo that shows you how to do it.
