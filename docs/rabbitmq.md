# Installation

## Check that it's working

If RabbitMQ's Management Plugin is enabled, you can use a browser or curl to check the status of the server:

```bash
curl -i http://<rabbitmq-host>:15672/api/overview
```
Replace `<rabbitmq-host>` with your RabbitMQ serverâ€™s hostname or IP address. The default port for the management interface is 15672. You might need to provide credentials if the management plugin requires authentication:

```bash
curl -i -u guest:guest http://<rabbitmq-host>:15672/api/overview
```

If successful, you will get a JSON response with information about the server.
